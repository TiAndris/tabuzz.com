    <h1>Support & Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the TABUZZ support page. Below, you'll find answers to frequently asked questions and our privacy policy.</p>

    <!-- GYIK Szekció -->
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Are my answers saved or stored?</strong>
            <p>No, your answers are not saved or stored by us. The purpose of the game is to encourage conversations, even with people you think you know best. The questions and tasks are meant to be answered verbally during the game.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>2. Do I have to answer every question?</strong>
            <p>As stated in the game, the goal is to spark conversations by answering the questions. However, just like in real life, you are free to refuse to answer any question you don’t feel comfortable with. Neither in the game nor in life are you required to answer questions you don’t want to.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>3. How can we play the Pregame Mode?</strong>
            <p>In the **Pregame Mode**, you will need a game master to read out the questions. Once the topic has been discussed, click the button to move to the next question.
                Naturally, how you play is up to your imagination—these are just suggestions to get you started. And just as in life, you can always say no and refuse to answer. Have fun!</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>4. How can we play the Dialogue Mode?</strong>
            <p>The **Dialogue Mode** can be played in two suggested ways:
                1. A game master reads out the question, and everyone answers.
                2. Pass the phone around: the current person reads and answers the question.
                Of course, how you play is entirely up to you and your creativity. These are only options to help get the game started. And remember, you can always say no and skip a question. Have fun!</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>5. Can I play the game without alcohol?</strong>
            <p>Absolutely! Not only is alcohol optional, but we **recommend playing without it**. For example, in the **Dialogue Mode**, drinking options cannot be enabled at all, and even in the **Pregame Mode**, we do not recommend consuming alcoholic beverages.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>6. How can I report a technical issue?</strong>
            <p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:support@tabuzz.hu">support@tabuzz.hu</a> for assistance.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>7. Can I play this game with children?</strong>
        <p>Yes, the app includes a **family** mode, and topics can be customized to suit the audience, making it suitable for playing with children.</p>
    </li>
        <li><strong>8. Are the questions only provocative?</strong>
            <p>No, while the app does include some thought-provoking questions, its primary focus is **educational**.
                The questions were developed in collaboration with trusted organizations, such as SzexEd and NANE, ensuring they are appropriate, educational, and non-offensive.
                Our goal is to foster understanding of each other’s **thoughts, stories, and perspectives**.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>9. What data does TABUZZ collect?</strong>
            <p>TABUZZ does not collect personal data directly. Data collection and processing are managed by third-party services: Google Ads and Meta Ads.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>10. What is the purpose of the game? Does it focus on alcohol consumption?</strong>
            <p>No, the purpose of the game is to **encourage meaningful conversations** and help participants get to know each other better.
                The drinking option is **optional**, only available for users aged 18+ and **alcohol consumption is not encouraged**. We do not suggest consuming alcoholic beverages during gameplay.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>11. How can I manage ad-related data permissions?</strong>
            <p>You can review and manage your ad data permissions through the following links:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Ads: <a href="https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/" target="_blank">Google User Consent Policy</a></li>

            <p>No, TABUZZ does not currently collect or process any data beyond what is required by Google Ads and Meta Ads for advertisement display.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>13. Where do the questions come from?</strong>
            <p>The questions were originally created by us and shared over the years on our @tabuzz.hu Instagram page. Based on these, we developed a database where we categorized and themed the questions, with the help of experts reviewing them. Some questions were even submitted by our followers. Naturally, there may be overlaps with other similar games, psychological, sociological, or other surveys. However, our database now contains almost 1,500 unique questions, growing daily, providing a truly unique and customizable gaming experience for different groups and audiences.</p>
